        <p class="brodtext"> Across low- and middle-income countries, mortality from infectious disease, malnutrition, 
          nutritional deficiencies, neonatal and maternal deaths are common and in some cases, dominant. 
          In Kenya, for example, diarrheal infections are still the primary cause of death. 
          HIV/AIDS is the major cause of death in South Africa and Botswana. 
          However, in high-income countries, the proportion of deaths due by these causes is quite low. <br></p>
