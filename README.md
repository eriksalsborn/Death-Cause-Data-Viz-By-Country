# Death-Cause-Data-Viz-By-Country

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file showcasing the process of importing datasets and creating visualizations for death causes by country on a geographic plot. The notebook leverages Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Altair, Seaborn, and NumPy for effective data manipulation and visualization.

This project was done in collaboration with Anders Lundkvist and further developed by me.

# Introduction 

In low- and middle-income countries, mortality rates attributed to infectious diseases, malnutrition, nutritional deficiencies, neonatal and maternal deaths are prevalent, often dominating the health landscape. For instance, in Kenya, diarrheal infections remain the primary cause of death, while HIV/AIDS stands as the leading cause in South Africa and Botswana. In contrast, high-income countries experience a significantly lower proportion of deaths from these causes.

The visualization can be used to address the following questions:

1. What are the most common causes of death by country?
2. Is there any correlation between geographical location and types of deaths?

# Datasets

The primary dataset includes information on causes of death across all genders and age groups, categorized by country. Additionally, three supplementary datasets providing details on country populations, coordinates, and continents were employed. 

The main dataset was sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) website: https://www.who.int/.
